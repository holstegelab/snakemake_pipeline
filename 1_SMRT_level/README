THIS FOLDER CONTAINS THE MAIN FILES FOR RUNNING THE FIRST STEP OF THE PIPELINE, AT THE SMRT CELL LEVEL

THIS FOLDER CONTAINS:
- bin:
  - extract_ccs_and_nonCCS_forDeepConsensus.py: python script to extract input for deepconsensus
  - extract_ccs_and_nonCCS.py: python script to extract input HiFi and non-HiFi reads
  - extract_read_information.py: python script to extract read information (number of passes, read length)
  - plot_read_information.R: R script to generate plot of the read length distribution and passes distribution
  - sample_check.py: python script to compare PacBio SNPs from pileup with SNP-array in order to match sample
  - snakemake_smrt.py: main snakemake pipeline
- config:
  - config_cluster.yml: configuration file for the cluster, reporting resources to use for each operation
  - config_file_example.yml: example configuration file for an actual run. In this file you need to specify the input subreads.bam and the output directory.
  - py37.yml: conda environment based on python3.7
  - py39.yml: conda environment based on pyrhon3.9

NB: the conda environments contain (slightly) outdated softwares, as we kept the same software versions during all our sequencing project, which lasted 3 years. No major changes should have happened in the latest software versions, but in case you want to use the latest versions, you need to download them separately. 
Also, the conda environments are likely redundant.

YOU WILL NEED TO ADJUST PATHS TO THE SOFTWARES TO THOSE PRESENT IN YOUR MACHINE. 

******
In order to run the snakemake pipeline, the command is the following:
snakemake -s /project/holstegelab/Software/snakemake_pipeline/bin/Snakefile_with_copy.py --latency-wait 60 --configfile [path/to/config_file.yml] --cluster "sbatch --ntasks {cluster.ntasks} -c {cluster.ncpupertask} --time {cluster.time}" --cluster-config [path/to/config_cluster.yml] --jobs 1
