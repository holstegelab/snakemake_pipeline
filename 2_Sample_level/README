THIS FOLDER CONTAINS THE MAIN FILES FOR RUNNING THE SECOND STEP OF THE PIPELINE, AT THE SAMPLE LEVEL

THIS FOLDER CONTAINS:
- config_cluster_sample.yml: configuration file for the cluster, reporting resources to use for each operation
- config_file_example.yml: example configuration file for an actual run. In this file you need to specify the list of single smrt cells to combine and the output directory.
- cpg.yml: conda environment based on python3.7
- snakemake_sample.py: main snakemake file

NB: the conda environments contain (slightly) outdated softwares, as we kept the same software versions during all our sequencing project, which lasted 3 years. No major changes should have happened in the latest software versions, but in case you want to use the latest versions, you need to download them separately. 
Also, the conda environments are likely redundant.

******
In order to run the snakemake pipeline, the command is the following:
snakemake -s [path/to/snakemake_sample.py] --latency-wait 60 --configfile [path/to/config_example_sample.yml] --cluster "sbatch --ntasks {cluster.ntasks} -c {cluster.ncpupertask} --time {cluster.time}" --cluster-config [path/to/config_cluster_sample.yml] --jobs 1

YOU WILL NEED TO ADJUST PATHS TO THE SOFTWARES TO THOSE PRESENT IN YOUR MACHINE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE BY EMAIL OR ON GITHUB:
